Natural language summary: The Mishna discusses the earliest time at which one may recite the Shema prayer in the evenings. Rabbi Eliezer says that the Kohanim (priests) may eat their tithes until the end of the first watch of the night, while the sages disagree, saying until midnight, and Raban Gamliel says until dawn. A story is shared about Raban Gamliel's visit to some other people's party where they did not recite the Shema until much later. He told them that they must recite the Shema before dawn and that all other rules of the sages also extend until dawn in order to distance oneself from wrongdoing.

In this passage, a Tanna teaches when to say the Shema prayer, both in the evening and in the morning. He explains that the night time reading is from the verse "when you lie down and when you rise," while the time for reciting the Shema in the morning is from the verse "Shema Yisrael." The Tanna then goes on to explain the specific time for reciting the Shema in the evening, and the specific blessings that should be said before and after the prayers. Finally, the Tanna explains that one should begin teaching the laws of the evening prayer and then move on to the laws of the morning prayer.

מלתא אגב אורחיה קמשמע לן: "this word with regards to its meaning teaches us", present tense, third person singular.

כהנים אימת קא אכלי בתרומה משעת צאת הכוכבים: "when do the priests eat from the tithes from the time of the stars' emergence".

והא קמשמע לן דכפרה לא מעכבא: "And this teaches us that atonement does not prevent", present tense, third person singular.

כדתניא (ויקרא כב, ז): "as it is taught (Leviticus 22:7)", past tense, third person singular.

ובא השמש וטהר: "And the sun sets and purifies", past tense, third person singular.

זביאת שמשו מעכבתו מלאכול בתרומה: "his semen emission prevents him from eating from the tithes".

ואין כפרתו מעכבתו מלאכול בתרומה: "but his atonement does not prevent him from eating from the tithes".

וממאי דהאי ובא השמש: "And from where (do we know) this (teaching) that 'And the sun sets'?", conjunction ו- indicating "and", preposition מ- indicating "from". 

וביאת השמש והאי וטהר טהר יומא: "the setting of the sun and this (teaching) that 'he purifies, he purifies that day'." 

In this text, the master clarifies when the priests are permitted to eat from their tithes, stating that they can eat from the tithes from the time that they enter to eat. The time of their eating must be from the time of the stars' emergence. The word "כהנים" refers to the priests, and this word teaches us that priests can eat from the tithes from the time of the stars' emergence. Atonement does not prevent the priests from eating, even if they have had a semen emission. This is because "the sun sets and purifies" an impure person, and the person is then permitted to eat from the tithes. The setting of the sun and the fact that the person purifies begin that day.

This applies to eating holy foods and reciting the Shema.

וכולם מתודה ילמדו – "and they will all learn thankfulness"; "m pl. present" - the people will acknowledge gratitude to God for allowing them to wake up and live through the night.

אם כן למה אמרו חכמים עד חצות – "If so, why did the Sages say until midnight"; "m pl. past" - This is a question as to why the limitations of eating and reciting the Shema until dawn were not stated to be until midnight only.

ולא נקט להו הכא אלא להודיע – "and it is not stated here except to inform"; The Sages did not limit burning the fats until midnight since it is permissible to perform this action throughout the night.

היכא קאי – "where is it referring to"; This is a question as to where in the Mishnah the specific time limitations are mentioned.

אקרא קאי – "referring to the recitation of the Shema"; The question is answered that the specific time limitation mentioned in the Mishnah is regarding when to recite the Shema.

ואי בעית אימא – "and if you want to say"; This introduces a hypothetical question regarding a statement in the Tosefta.

הא דתנא ערבין ברישא, יליף מברייתו של עולם – "this which the Tosefta teaches at the beginning, he should learn from its statement in Genesis"; Here Rabbi Judah HaNasi is asserting that the proper understanding can be found by examining a statement in Genesis.
