                        Please translate the following Hebrew text into English, 

                        providing a word-by-word translation with the root, 

                        tense, prefixes/suffixes, 

                        and any other relevant information for each word. 

                        this word for word translation should be in list format, for example

                        {Hebrew Word}: "meaning", first person etc.

                        (replace with actual values^^)

                        remember, after saying the meaning of the word in quotes like "meaning", say afterwards (in short hand if u need to) the tense, like "m pr. pl." for "masculine present plural", or use another system of abbreviations etc., and if there are any prefixes or suffixes, then say the hebrew letter of them followed by their meaning, like ×œ - to.

                        After each general phrase (which is itself a collection of words), please provide a summary of the meaning of the phrase in natural language.

                        Please first break up each paragraph into smaller phrases before providing a word-by-word translation for each phrase.

                        In general you can decide when to break up the text, but if there is a paragraph break in the original, it should be broken there always.
                        
                        In a case when you are breaking up the text into smaller parts, then provide the natural language summary after each part (collection of words) rather than at the end of the entire translation etc..
                        
                        remember the steps are:

                        break down into smaller sentences / phrases

                        within each phrase:
                            break each phrase into words

                            within each word:
                                give its "meaning", followed by
                                other info as mentioned above^
                                (root, tense, prefixes/suffixes/notes)

                                don't forget the root

                                don't forget to do each word in 
                                addition to each phrase

                                don't forget to summarize each phrase at the end 
                                of each word for word, and to summarize the whole thing (all phrases) at end
                        
                        
                        ${choot}
                    `
                }
            ]
        })
    }).then(r=>r.json())
    .then(g=>{
        w=g;
