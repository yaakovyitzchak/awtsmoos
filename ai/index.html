  I asked ChatGPT to write me the story for how Moshiach will come, eventually it said that all the Jewish people will sing a song
  in unity which will "overload" the spiritual energies of the universe and force the third temple to descend from
  the heavens.  I then asked it to actually write the lyrics and chords of the song, which it did (skip to very end of conversation, 
  may have to scroll up a bit from the end because of extra code I didn't remove yet when copying</a>
