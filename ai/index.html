  I asked ChatGPT to write me the story for how Moshiach will come, eventually it said that all the Jewish people will sing a song
  in unity which will "overload" the spiritual energies of the universe and force the third temple to descend from
  the heavens.  I then asked it to actually write the lyrics and chords of the song, which it did (skip to very end of conversation, 
  may have to scroll up a bit from the end because of extra code I didn't remove yet when copying</a>

<P>
The following is not the same song as in the
 conversation above, but afterwards I opened 
a new session and just asked it to write a
 generic song about the theme of
Chabad and spreading the teachings

Of the Ball Shem Tov etc and this is
What it wrote (again in addition to the
One at the end of the above conversation):
