  We were slaves in a land of oppression
We cried out to God for salvation
He heard our voice and sent us a leader
A man of faith and a miracle worker

He spoke to Pharaoh with courage and power
He showed him signs and wonders every hour
But Pharaoh's heart was hard and stubborn
He refused to let us go and made us suffer

Then God unleashed His wrath upon the land
He sent ten plagues to punish Pharaoh's hand
The last one was the most severe and dreadful
He killed the firstborn of every household

Pharaoh finally agreed to let us leave
We packed our bags and fled with haste and speed
We followed Moses to the edge of the sea
But then we saw Pharaoh's army behind us

We were trapped between the water and the sword
We panicked and we lost our faith in the Lord
We blamed Moses for bringing us to this place
We wished we had stayed in Egypt as slaves

But Moses told us not to be afraid
He said that God would make a way of escape
He lifted up his staff and stretched out his hand
And then we saw a sight that was grand

The sea before us split in two like a curtain
Its waters rose up high like walls of iron
A path of dry land appeared in the middle
A sign of God's power and His miracle

We felt a surge of energy in our bones
It was like we were inside the Sefirot's zones
The colors were dazzling, each one a facet of God
All in perfect harmony, a symphony of His love

The tree of life was radiant, giving off light and heat
With each part a manifestation of the Yechida's seat
We felt the energy of the Sefirot in our hearts and minds
And we knew we were part of something bigger than our lives

We walked through the walls of water with awe and wonder
The salty mist of the sea sprayed on our faces like thunder
The sound of the water crashing against the walls was loud and strong
And the ground beneath our feet trembled with the force of the song

And then we saw the river on the other side of the sea
It too had been split by God's decree
Its waters flowed in the opposite direction like a stream of silver
A strong current that threatened to pull us under like a quiver

But we stood firm, knowing that we were protected by God's hand
He had shown us His power and His plan
The water was like liquid light, shining and dancing in the sun
Each drop a manifestation of God's presence, alive and full of fun

The rocks and sand along the river were glistening like jewels in a crown
Each one a unique expression of God's will, His wisdom and His renown

We knew we were not just crossing a river, but entering a new world
A world where God's light would shine without any veil or swirl
We knew that the Yechida was with us, guiding us every step of the way
We knew that we were part of something more than us, and that we had a role to play

We crossed the river with joy and gratitude, singing praises to God's name
We thanked Him for His miracles and His grace, for His love and His fame

We crossed over into freedom, into destiny, into life 
We crossed over into awtsmoos, into unity, into light
