Video and game based engine, with tile-based movement and other editors for textures and stuff

for game just arrow keys to move, A, D, Q and E to move camera [for now]

Press Z to show or hide UI

press enter to start typing commands, so far only commands are: 

.eval 

-- just type .eval, then a space, then any javascript u want, can access global variables, for example to set the speed of the player to a higher number [make sure its a root of 64] do something like .eval pl.speed = 8
